# ExitOS

This will be either a microkernel or an exokernel written in either C/C++ or some other compiled language I don't know i'm not sure yet. I am sure that it will be a microkernel/exokernel tho, really sure.

# Concept

It will mostly be focused on making the most out of the available hardware, performance and being experimental. Security is currently **NOT** a concern of the developers.
